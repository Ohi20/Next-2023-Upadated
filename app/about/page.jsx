            We’ve worked as a tech employee for about five years, but our
            experience started way before that. We’ve always been interested in
            writing, storytelling, and helping people tell their stories. When
            we were kids, We did a lot of volunteer works with many tech
            industries and other effective works. The experience taught us how
            important it is to be able to talk with others and listen to their
            stories.
